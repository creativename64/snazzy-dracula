      <p>Alright, so this one is going to be heavy, and long. You're gonna want to strap in for this one. So, let's get into it. </p><p>Firstly, you don't technically need to have read the Hunger Games trilogy, or watched the movies, to be able to read this. There are some similarities, but I've changed a lot of things. If you have read or watched it, then you'll see the similarities and differences with ease; if not, then it won't really change much for you. </p><p>To be clear, I haven't read the books in years, and it's been a while since I watched the movies myself, so it won't exactly be the same. I basically just took the plot and loosely used it for these characters and their dynamics. For example, I can't remember the exact ages for people being reaped in the books, but in this fic, it's set between thirteen and twenty-five. Another thing is, it's not divided up by gender, and I have gender neutral characters in this as well. Men, women, and anyone of any gender can be (and are) reaped. </p><p>In this, Sirius is a mentor because he's already been to the arena. Because we see his POV, we see how this affected him, dealing with things such as PTSD, mental illness, and references to past addiction. </p><p>This fic deals with themes of death in every way there is to depict it, up to and including murder (referenced and described), suicide (referenced and described), mercy killing (referenced and described), and just as a background part of the story because of, ya know, the whole thing where people are thrown into an arena and forced to kill each other. </p><p>There's also in-depth explorations of power dynamics, grief, and complicated relationships. This fic can get dark and heavy at times, and it will, but I will always provide proper warnings to the best of my abilities for every chapter. However, that being said, there are a lot of light and fluffy moments, as well as a lot of humor, despite the setting. And this fic WILL have a happy ending, because I really can't write anything else. </p><p>I didn't tag for Major Character Death because no character that gets a POV will die. I DID tag for Minor Character Death because people will, in fact, die in this fic. Characters that you will recognize, and probably some that you'll even like, and even those that you won't like. Not everyone will die, obviously, but not everyone will survive either. </p><p>This fic isn't for everyone, and that's okay. Absolutely do not read it if you're expecting a happy story from start to finish. I have a happy, long fic with queer characters and no death, but this isn't going to be that. This will be angsty, and complicated, and there will be gallows humor that not everyone will be comfortable with, as well as rough relationships and harsh realities paired with this setting. It gets brutal at times, so just be warned and prepared for that. Take care of yourselves first and foremost. </p><p>Warnings for this first chapter: references to death, references to murder, references to child abuse (yeah, Walburga and Orion are shit in any universe), a very brief reference to suicide (blink and you miss it), references to addiction, and plenty of angst. </p><p>If it's any comfort to you at all, this chapter has Regulus, James, and Sirius POV, so at least you know they won't be dying. Hope that helps! </p><p>Enjoy???</p>

    <p>
  <span>The 84th annual reaping is supposed to be Regulus' last.&nbsp;</span>
</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>
  <span>He's twenty-five, and he'll be twenty-six before the next, which means he'll age out. His birthday takes place two days before the reaping each year, so he has a rather fortunate stroke of luck in that regard.&nbsp;</span>
</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>
  <span>James Potter doesn't, as it turns out. He's only two months away from twenty-six, and if only he was born just a few months earlier, he could have escaped his fate.&nbsp;</span>
</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>
  <span>His name is the first that's called, and Regulus can't stop himself from looking through the crowd to watch James slowly push out into the open. His parents are quietly weeping. A lump forms in Regulus' throat as he drags his gaze from James to the stage, where Sirius is already standing, his jaw clenched as he nods at James when he climbs the steps up.&nbsp;</span>
</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>
  <span>There is no doubt in Regulus' mind that Sirius is going to do everything in his power to make sure James survives the arena. He'll beg, borrow, and steal; he'll teach James everything he needs to know; he'll be the best mentor their distract has ever seen, and he'll get his best friend home. Whoever the other tribute turns out to be, Regulus preemptively feels sorry for them, because there is no life Sirius will put above James'.</span>
</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>
  <span>"Regulus Black!"&nbsp;</span>
</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>
  <span>That's the second time Regulus has heard his name called at a reaping—and here he was, daring to think he was lucky.&nbsp;</span>
</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>
  <span>The first time he heard it, he was fifteen, only just, and he'd felt his whole body go cold as soon as he did. He hadn't even moved at first, too terrified to, unable to fathom how it had happened to him. It had to happen to someone, but no one ever thinks it's going to be them, until it is.&nbsp;</span>
</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>
  <span>Regulus had gotten two steps out of the line when Sirius burst out and volunteered in his stead, only sixteen and ready to throw himself on the pyre so Regulus wouldn't have to.&nbsp;</span>
</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>
  <span>Sirius had gone to the arena, and Regulus didn't think he was going to come home. He watched, day after day, as his brother fought for his life. He watched, day after day, as Sirius ran, starved, and murdered just to make it back. He watched, on that last day, as Sirius broke down when he was announced the Victor, laughing like a madman on the screens.&nbsp;</span>
</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>
  <span>He was never the same after that.&nbsp;</span>
</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>
  <span>Ten years later, and it's happening again. There is no one to volunteer in his stead this time, because Sirius is a Victor, and he can't. No one else would, and maybe even if he could, all these years later, neither would Sirius.&nbsp;</span>
</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>
  <span>Regulus—just like last time—finds himself frozen, a horrible dread crawling through his veins like ice. The only thought he has is </span>
  <em>
    <span>why, why me, why this? </span>
  </em>
  <span>Whispers break out through the entire courtyard, and Regulus knows the reason behind it, what they're all saying. It's no secret that James is Sirius' best friend, and no one could ever forget that Regulus is his little brother. Oh, they're going to love this in the Hallow.&nbsp;</span>
</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>
  <span>Next to him, Barty nudges his shoulder, looking at him with his lips pressed into a thin line, and so Regulus moves. He forces himself to, putting one foot in front of the other, feeling untethered from his body as he makes his way to the stage. As he climbs the steps, his gaze lifts to meet Sirius', and Sirius looks back for all of five seconds before his eyes sink shut, like if he's not looking, then it's not real.&nbsp;</span>
</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>
  <span>Regulus wishes it was that simple.&nbsp;</span>
</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>
  <span>It isn't.&nbsp;</span>
</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>
  <span>He looks away from his brother, and he finds his gaze crawling to James next. For a long moment, they just stare at each other, and then they both look away all at once.&nbsp;</span>
</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align="center">
  <span>~•~&nbsp;</span>
</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>
  <span>James is pretty sure he's about to throw up. The only reason he doesn't, he thinks, is because his parents are here. Despite all of this, Effie's hands cradling his face grounds him.&nbsp;</span>
</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>
  <span>"Oh, love," Effie whispers, her mouth twisting.&nbsp;</span>
</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>
  <span>"Mum," James croaks, his eyes stinging. He drinks the sight of her in, as well as his dad, darting his gaze between them both. He's never going to see them again, after this.&nbsp;</span>
</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>
  <span>Effie swallows harshly. "Don't look like that, James. You can win. Do you understand? You can."&nbsp;</span>
</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>
  <span>She would know. As the winner of the 44th hunger games forty years ago, at the age of a mere thirteen years old, she </span>
  <em>
    <span>would </span>
  </em>
  <span>know. It was her first reaping, one slip in the bowl, and no one thought she would survive—but she did. She doesn't talk about it, she never talks about it, and Sirius knows more about it than James does. Effie was his mentor, after all, and she helped him get home. And then, when he was eighteen, her duties as a mentor could be over, if Sirius stepped up to take her place, which he did.&nbsp;</span>
</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>
  <span>James has lived in the Victor's Village his entire life, and Sirius has been his best friend since he was eleven, when he snuck over the wall behind the village and tumbled down an incline, right into Sirius. They had seen each before, of course, from afar, but they lived different lives at the time. James had personal tutors—a perk of being in the Victor's Village—and Sirius went to school. When they properly met, the first thing they did as children was fight (because they both snuck out and thought the other would get them in trouble), and less than twenty minutes later, they promised to be best friends forever—and it's a promise neither of them have broken.&nbsp;</span>
</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>
  <span>When Sirius volunteered for Regulus at only sixteen years old, James had felt like something in him shriveled and broke off, never to be found again. He remembers that, remembers fighting so hard to see Sirius before he left, and he only got a few seconds to hug him before he was being dragged away, right out of James' arms. The last thing Sirius had said to him was a plea. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Take care of Regulus, James, please, </span>
  </em>
  <span>he'd begged.</span>
</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>
  <span>James tried to, but Regulus was a hard person to take care of then at fifteen, and still is at twenty-five, James presumes. He's not sure what it is, but Regulus stopped liking him at fifteen. James didn't need him to like him, not to look after him, but Regulus dodged him at every turn. He took care of himself, mostly, no matter how much James tried. Really, there was only so much James could do. The only time Regulus didn't avoid him was the days they gathered together in the courtyard to watch Sirius in the arena. Just once, James remembers that Regulus had reached out to grab his hand, clinging to it as they both watched Sirius get attacked and then brutally murder his attacker.&nbsp;</span>
</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>
  <span>When Sirius and his family moved into the Victor's Village after he returned from the arena, sixteen years old with war in his bones and ghosts in his eyes, James was the one who took care of him. Certainly not his parents, who have only ever been neglectful and abusive. Regulus—well, he couldn't take care of Sirius. It wasn't that simple. Sirius wasn't the same as he was before he went into the arena, and it was James who was talking him through the hallucinations; it was James who got him to laugh for the first time after he made it home; it was James who made sure he ate, who pulled him back from the brink of addiction, who held him when he was falling apart.&nbsp;</span>
</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>
  <span>James is his best friend, and he made a promise, and that's only part of the reason he looks at his mother and smiles sadly before whispering, "I'm not coming home, Mum."&nbsp;</span>
</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>
  <span>"James," Monty says gruffly, his eyes shining. James' dad is a quiet man, despite his stature. A gentle giant, Effie has always called him, when she's not calling him </span>
  <em>
    <span>Flea </span>
  </em>
  <span>to tease him, purely for the irony. Fleas are tiny; Fleamont Potter is the opposite. He's a simple man, overall, a homebody and a scholar, happy to be with his family, a loving husband, and the best dad James could ask for. He looks heartbroken. "Son, don't—don't say that. If you fight—"&nbsp;</span>
</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>
  <span>"I'll fight," James cuts in quietly. "I will fight. But, when it's the end, and it's me and him… I won't fight him."&nbsp;</span>
</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>
  <span>Effie's eyes sink shut, her lips trembling before she tucks them in and ducks her head. She slides her hands from his cheeks to grip his shoulders, squeezing them. A horrible sound escapes her throat, and she sounds broken as she whispers, </span>
  <em>
    <span>"Please."&nbsp;</span>
  </em>
</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>
  <span>"I'm sorry," James breathes out, swallowing harshly. Monty looks away, his jaw working as his tears fall. A shuddering breath leaves Effie, and she lifts her head to stare at him, her face sagging with sadness. James tries for a smile, but it trembles on his face. "Mum, Dad, I'm sorry. I can't do it. I won't do that to Sirius. I'm going to make sure Regulus gets out. That's what I'm going to be fighting to do."&nbsp;</span>
</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>
  <span>"There are—countless ways to die in the arena, James," Effie says hoarsely. "You want to fight to get Regulus out? Fine, but if—just </span>
  <em>
    <span>if </span>
  </em>
  <span>he doesn't make it, if something happens, you fight with everything you have in you to get home, do you understand? Your heart—you have such a big heart, so full of love, and I never want you to lose that, but in there? You can't let that get in the way of your survival."&nbsp;</span>
</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>
  <span>James nods tentatively. "Alright, Mum. Alright, but that's not going to happen, because I'm getting him out, even if it kills me." He pauses, then cracks a weak smile. "Well, it will kill me, actually, so really—"&nbsp;</span>
</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>
  <span>"James, don't make jokes right now," Monty cuts in.&nbsp;</span>
</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>
  <span>"This is how I want you to remember me," James whispers, and they stare at him, stricken. "This, right here, because what happens in there, before I'm gone… That's not what I want you to remember. Would it be too much to ask to not watch?"</span>
</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>
  <span>"Yes," Effie says firmly. "You're our son, James. There is nothing you could do in that arena that would change how we see you, or how much we love you. We—we love you so much."</span>
</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>
  <span>"I love you too, Mum. I love both of you," James rasps, feeling like he hasn't explained enough, like his words are inadequate to properly express how grateful he is to have them.&nbsp;</span>
</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>
  <span>Effie draws him into a tight hug, and Monty moves over to wrap his arms around them both, and James closes his eyes and lets his parents hold him. Most people don't know when they'll get to hug their parents for the last time.&nbsp;</span>
</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>
  <span>James does.&nbsp;</span>
</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align="center">
  <span>~•~&nbsp;</span>
</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>
  <span>Sirius paces back and forth, listening to the quiet murmurs of his parents through the door. He can't hear Regulus respond, which means he isn't. Sirius can guess what their parents are saying without having to hear it, just clipped orders to come home, or not die a death that shames the family. No different than they told Sirius ten years ago.</span>
</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>
  <span>Sirius came home, after doing shameful things to get back, things that still live under his fingernails and behind his eyelids to this day. He didn't die a death to shame the family, but since coming back, he's lived a life that sure has.&nbsp;</span>
</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>
  <span>Well, that's how his parents see it, in any case. Sometimes it's hard coming from an extended family of Victors, only more so when you're a Victor yourself. Sirius finds it ridiculous, really, because it's not as if Walburga or Orion have ever been to the arena. Just Alphard, Cygnus, Bellatrix, and Narcissa—all who were Victors. Alphard hadn't handled the aftermath of the arena well and made many public scenes before eventually, essentially killing himself on booze and bad health. Cygnus had handled it well and raised three daughters who would too, if they ever found themselves in that situation. And, when Bellatrix and Narcissa did, they proved it.&nbsp;</span>
</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>
  <span>After her games, Narcissa went off to marry someone in the first district, closest to the Hallow. Being a Victor, she could, and she could also take her sisters with her when she went. Bellatrix left with her, but Andromeda did not. She stayed behind to settle down with a man named Ted, who the family didn't approve of at all. She's estranged from the family now, but not Sirius, who is always sneaking off to go see her and little Nymphadora, the cutest baby he's ever met. Walburga and Orion gave up on Sirius years ago now, and they haven't spoken to him or acknowledged him for a long time, despite happily using the benefits they get because he's a Victor. They still control Regulus, though, so they forbid him from seeing Andromeda, and Regulus listens.&nbsp;</span>
</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>
  <span>Of course Regulus listens, because if he doesn't, it never ends well. Sirius can understand that, even if it drives him mental, because </span>
  <em>
    <span>he </span>
  </em>
  <span>never listened. Expecting the same out of Regulus is pointless. Regulus only does what he's willing to do.&nbsp;</span>
</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>
  <span>It's going to get him killed.&nbsp;</span>
</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>
  <span>Sirius' stomach twists. He remembers when he volunteered for his little brother, the first person to volunteer in decades, at least in their district. He had to, though, because as soon as he heard Regulus' name called, he knew his little brother would die. Regulus—at that age—would never survive the arena.&nbsp;</span>
</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>
  <span>Frankly, Sirius wasn't sure </span>
  <em>
    <span>he </span>
  </em>
  <span>would survive the arena, but he did. Sometimes he wishes he hadn't. Sometimes he hates Regulus for being someone he loves so much that he would go for him. But never—not once—has Sirius regretted it. He will never regret saving his little brother's life.&nbsp;</span>
</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>
  <span>This feels like being spit in the face. Like he was just putting off the inevitable. Because here Regulus is, his name still echoing in Sirius' ears, and Sirius can't save him this time.</span>
</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>
  <span>And then there's James.&nbsp;</span>
</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>
  <span>Just thinking about it makes Sirius' stomach lurch. His best friend. Fuck, his </span>
  <em>
    <span>best friend </span>
  </em>
  <span>is going to the arena, too, and Sirius can't take his place either. James is—he's Sirius' whole world, honestly. Without him, Sirius wouldn't be alive right now. Without him, Sirius wouldn't know what to do.&nbsp;</span>
</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>
  <span>James is going into the arena with Regulus. How is that fair? What does Sirius even do with that? It makes him want to scream, to bang against the walls of some inner enclosure, to collide his fist into whatever is closest until his mind is quiet. He can't do this. He can't—he doesn't know how he's going to do this. He doesn't have a fucking choice.&nbsp;</span>
</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>
  <span>Sirius is meant to train them. To prepare them. To teach them. He's meant to give them every trick, tip, and tool to survive, then watch them go face down death. Sirius has never brought a tribute home, not once in the last eight years, and now his little brother and best friend are going to be looking to him for help. He doesn't know how to tell them that there's no help for them, that really, at the end of the day, it comes down to a person's desperate need to survive.&nbsp;</span>
</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>
  <span>He can put weapons in their hands, teach them how to keep from dying of dehydration or starvation, make them memorize poisonous plants, and give them the general do's and do not's to better their chances—but the truth is, they'll only survive if they want to badly enough. Sirius won his games by strangling a man to death with his bare hands—not his first kill, or even his most gruesome—but he was starved out of his mind, halfway dead from dehydration, and bleeding out. The man had a knife, and Sirius had a stab wound. The man had the upper hand, and Sirius had the will to survive.&nbsp;</span>
</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>
  <span>The man should have lived, and Sirius made sure he didn't.&nbsp;</span>
</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>
  <span>It's strange, because Sirius thinks—and has always thought, since winning—that dying in the arena is a kindness, really. But that was before people he loved became tributes. Maybe it's selfish, because whether it's a kindness or not, he wants them both to survive anyway, and they can't. Not both.&nbsp;</span>
</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>
  <span>This is like trying to ask Sirius to choose between his heart and his lungs. The heart stops beating if the lungs won't work, and the lungs won't work if the heart stops beating. They have to coexist; he can't survive the loss of either.&nbsp;</span>
</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>
  <span>The door opens up as Walburga and Orion step out, and they both pause to look at him for a moment as he wrenches to a halt. All his mother says is an order, "Bring him home."</span>
</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>
  <span>With that, and nothing else, they leave.&nbsp;</span>
</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>
  <span>Taking a deep breath, Sirius moves forward and slips through the door, his heart clenching when he sees Regulus. He looks so small, despite being twenty-five, but maybe that's because Sirius is looking at him and seeing him as he was when he was only fifteen. Just his little brother. Always his little brother.&nbsp;</span>
</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>
  <span>They don't talk the way they used to. They're too different, and at the same time, too much alike. Sirius has been through too much, and Regulus has distanced himself. Regulus is still in that house with their overbearing parents, and maybe they don't beat either of them now that they're older, but that doesn't mean their parenting has improved. Sirius hasn't been back home since he was sixteen, since he properly left and moved in with the Potters just up the street. He'd asked Regulus to come with him once. Regulus refused.&nbsp;</span>
</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>
  <span>"I have the worst luck," Regulus declares dryly, and Sirius stares at him for a long moment before huffing out a weak laugh and shutting the door. To anyone else, Regulus would likely look unruffled, just vaguely annoyed, but Sirius can see the fear flickering dimly in his eyes. He's trying to cover it, but Sirius has seen too much of that in his life to miss it now, no matter how distant they are. "I mean, I'm literally the only person in the world who has been reaped twice."</span>
</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>
  <span>"Yeah, that's just shit," Sirius admits. He leans back against the door and lets his head hit it with a dull thunk.&nbsp;</span>
</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>
  <span>Silence falls between them, heavy and thick. Sirius remembers when it was him as a tribute. Regulus had waited until they were alone before holding onto him and crying, begging him not to go, </span>
  <em>
    <span>begging </span>
  </em>
  <span>him to come back. Sirius remembers when he did come back, and everything felt—warped. The entire world was, and he thinks Regulus may have hugged him again when he returned, but he can't remember that. His memories are like a kaleidoscope, just fractured light, sometimes impossible to make out, and always shifting.&nbsp;</span>
</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>
  <span>The memories set before the arena are faint, and they feel like something directly from another life. The memories set right after the arena, even a year after, are like wisps; he can barely make them out, and he doesn't know what's there. That's an entire year of his life, at least, that he can't even recall. If not for James, he likely would have lived that way forever.&nbsp;</span>
</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>
  <span>The thing is, Sirius went into the arena and fought so hard to come home, completely unaware of what he would be bringing back with him when did. You bring pieces of the arena with you if you live long enough to get out, and those pieces still stay with Sirius to this day. James or Regulus will understand that, if they survive. One or the other, but it can't be both.&nbsp;</span>
</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>
  <span>Sirius doesn't know how he's supposed to live with that.&nbsp;</span>
</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>
  <span>"Have you been to see James?" Regulus murmurs.&nbsp;</span>
</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>
  <span>"He's with his parents," Sirius replies, blinking at some fixed point over Regulus' shoulder. "I wanted to give them time."&nbsp;</span>
</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>
  <span>Regulus scoffs. "So you came to see me first. What an honor."&nbsp;</span>
</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>
  <span>"Don't," Sirius says firmly, snapping his gaze to Regulus, meeting his eyes. "Don't do that, Regulus. Your resentment, your bitterness, whatever it is—that can't matter anymore, do you understand? There's no space for anything else but your will to survive. Listen to me—no, shut up." Regulus' mouth snaps shut from where he started to speak, to protest no doubt, but Sirius has never been more serious in his fucking life. "You leave all of that here. Anything that could make you falter, that could get in the way of your survival, you let it go right here and now. It can't exist in the games."</span>
</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>
  <span>"The games haven't started yet," Regulus whispers.&nbsp;</span>
</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>
  <span>"The games started the moment your name was called, and they don't end until you're dead," Sirius corrects bluntly.&nbsp;</span>
</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>
  <span>"Do you think I'm going to die?" Regulus asks.&nbsp;</span>
</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>
  <span>Sirius' breath catches, his heart clenching violently in his chest at the mere </span>
  <em>
    <span>thought. </span>
  </em>
  <span>Regulus holds his gaze steadily, waiting, and Sirius doesn't know. He doesn't know if his little brother is going to die. He doesn't know if his best friend is going to die. He doesn't know how he's going to try to help them survive, knowing only one will.&nbsp;</span>
</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>
  <span>Exhaling shakily, Sirius can only say, "You have a one in twenty-four chance, Regulus."&nbsp;</span>
</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>
  <span>"Your best friend is one of those twenty-four," Regulus reminds him. "Are you going to ask me not to kill him?" He waits again, but Sirius doesn't know how to answer that. He doesn't know what he's doing. "Because I will, if I have to. I'm not going to spare his life and sacrifice my own just because he matters to you. I might not go out of my way to kill him, but if that's what it comes to, Sirius, I won't hesitate."&nbsp;</span>
</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>
  <span>And, if it were anyone else other than James, Sirius would be relieved to hear that, to know that Regulus plans to fight to survive. But it is James, so Sirius' lungs feel like they're being </span>
  <em>
    <span>squeezed, </span>
  </em>
  <span>and dread sinks down in his stomach like lead.&nbsp;</span>
</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>
  <span>"Are you planning on coming home, Reggie?" Sirius rasps.&nbsp;</span>
</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>
  <span>"Yes," Regulus says firmly.&nbsp;</span>
</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>
  <span>"Well," Sirius whispers, working his jaw, then he gives a tight nod and reaches for the door, "I suppose I should go see him, then, since you're so willing to send him to his grave."&nbsp;</span>
</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>
  <span>"Are you willing to send me to mine, for him?" Regulus retorts sharply, a muscle in his cheek twitching as he clenches his jaw. His eyes are cold. They always are, these days.&nbsp;</span>
</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>
  <span>Sirius turns around, opens the door, and walks out.&nbsp;</span>
</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>
  <span>James isn't too far away, and Sirius arrives just as Effie and Monty are being escorted out. They've both been crying profusely, that much is obvious, and Sirius wants to go to them, call out for their attention, and find some way to make this better. He can't, though, so he stays back, letting them sweep away without noticing him.&nbsp;</span>
</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>
  <span>As soon as James looks up to see Sirius, he moves forward to snatch him into a hug. It takes everything in Sirius not to break down crying, but he refuses, because it's not him about to be thrown into the arena—just two of the people he loves most in this world. James holds onto him like he'll never get another chance, and Sirius… Sirius knows what that means.&nbsp;</span>
</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>
  <span>"No," Sirius croaks as he backs away, as if he's been stung. He shakes his head, unwilling to face it. "No, James, don't you fucking dare. Don't—"&nbsp;</span>
</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>
  <span>"Stop," James cuts in gently, reaching out to grab his shoulders and meet his gaze. "It's not up for debate, Sirius. I'm going to get him home, do you understand?"&nbsp;</span>
</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>
  <span>Sirius hears the whimper that falls out of his mouth, and the worst part is, this isn't even all that surprising. Of course James would do this. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Of course </span>
  </em>
  <span>he would, because he's selfless and golden, because he's </span>
  <em>
    <span>good. </span>
  </em>
  <span>Not necessarily out of the kindness of his heart—even if there's plenty in there—but just because he knows what he will and won't be able to live with. His morals, his sense of what's right—he'll die for them.&nbsp;</span>
</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>
  <span>In the arena, there is no sense of what's right, or morals. It's survival, and that's it. You have to do what it takes to survive, even when what it takes is the worst thing you can imagine. One split second of hesitation because you want to be good is how you die in the arena. Good doesn't exist there, and if it tries to, it's quickly snuffed out. James isn't—he isn't cut out for things like that. He's bright and loving, despite this shithole of a world, and he cares about things and people more than anyone Sirius has ever known.</span>
</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>
  <span>That's going to get him killed.&nbsp;</span>
</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>
  <span>Helplessly, Sirius thinks about the difference between James and Regulus, how one didn't hesitate to tell him that he wouldn't sacrifice himself, while the other didn't hesitate to tell him the exact opposite. Sirius can't stomach it.&nbsp;</span>
</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>
  <span>"James," Sirius chokes out.&nbsp;</span>
</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>
  <span>"I said it wasn't a debate, and don't—" James takes a deep breath, then slowly lets it out. "He's your little brother."&nbsp;</span>
</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>
  <span>"You're my best friend."&nbsp;</span>
</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>
  <span>"Exactly. It's one of the reasons I've made this decision."&nbsp;</span>
</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>
  <span>Sirius flinches. "You can't—"&nbsp;</span>
</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>
  <span>"I said </span>
  <em>
    <span>one," </span>
  </em>
  <span>James interrupts, holding his gaze. "Just one among many, Sirius. This isn't on you, alright? And we're not going to talk about it. You're going to get me ready, and I'm going to go in there and get Regulus home, and that's it. Don't for a second think I'll regret this. It's my choice, and you're going to respect it, do you understand? That's all I'm asking you to do. Just respect it."&nbsp;</span>
</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>I can't, </span>
  </em>
  <span>Sirius thinks. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Thank you, </span>
  </em>
  <span>Sirius thinks. </span>
  <em>
    <span>I want both of you to come home, </span>
  </em>
  <span>Sirius thinks. </span>
  <em>
    <span>I don't know how I'm supposed to do this, </span>
  </em>
  <span>Sirius thinks. And, in the end, Sirius says nothing.&nbsp;</span>
</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>
  <span>James pulls him back into a hug until, for the second time in a role-reversal Sirius could have never prepared himself for, he's being yanked right out of James' arms.&nbsp;</span>
